## Project Folder: traffic-sign

This project focuses on traffic sign recognition using machine learning techniques.

### Language

The project is implemented in Python.

### Training Model

The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for traffic sign recognition. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks.

### Libraries and Frameworks

The project makes use of the following libraries and frameworks:

- TensorFlow: A popular deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.
- OpenCV: A computer vision library used for image processing and manipulation.
- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides various algorithms and tools for data analysis.
- NumPy: A library for numerical computing in Python.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating visualizations in Python.

### Data

The project uses a dataset of traffic sign images. The dataset consists of thousands of labeled images representing different types of traffic signs.

### Tools

In addition to the aforementioned libraries and frameworks, the project also utilizes the following tools:

- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive development environment for running code and visualizing data.
- Anaconda: A Python distribution that includes many pre-installed libraries and tools for scientific computing.
